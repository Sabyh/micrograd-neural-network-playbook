You're absolutely right! Let me explain this from the very beginning with simple examples.

## What is a Computational Graph?

Think of it like a recipe or a flow chart that shows how to calculate something step by step.## Two Ways to Use Computational Graphs

There are two main ways computers can handle calculations:## Real Examples: How Different Libraries Work## A Real-World Analogy## So What Does This Mean for You?

Your `Value` class uses the **immediate** approach (like PyTorch). When you write:

```python
a = Value(3)
b = Value(4)
c = a + b  # This calculates 7 RIGHT NOW
```

TinyGrad uses the **lazy** approach. When someone writes:

```python
a = Tensor([3])  
b = Tensor([4])
c = a + b  # This DOESN'T calculate yet, just remembers "add a and b"
result = c.realize()  # NOW it calculates
```

## Which Should You Choose?

For learning, I recommend starting with the **immediate approach** (like your current `Value` class) because:

1. ✅ **Easier to understand** - you see results right away
2. ✅ **Easier to debug** - if something's wrong, you know immediately  
3. ✅ **Simpler to implement** - no need for complex scheduling
4. ✅ **More like PyTorch** - the most popular framework

Later, if you want to learn optimization, you can explore the lazy approach.

The main concepts to understand:
- **Immediate**: Do math as you write code (simple, like calculator)
- **Lazy**: Remember what to do, then do it all at once (complex, but can be faster)

Your `Value` class is actually a great foundation! You're building the same concepts that PyTorch uses.
