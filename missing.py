print("="*50)

print("""
WHAT YOU HAVE NOW: ~15-20% of a complete deep learning library
• ✅ The conceptual foundation (autodiff)
• ✅ Basic tensor operations
• ✅ Simple neural networks

WHAT A MINIMAL USEFUL LIBRARY NEEDS: ~40-50%
• ❌ Proper convolution operations
• ❌ GPU acceleration
• ❌ Advanced optimizers
• ❌ Data loading utilities
• ❌ Model save/load

WHAT PYTORCH-LEVEL COMPLETENESS NEEDS: ~90-95%  
• ❌ All the above plus...
• ❌ Distributed training
• ❌ Production deployment
• ❌ Extensive ecosystem
• ❌ Years of optimization

🎯 REALISTIC MILESTONES:

6 MONTHS: Educational library (like TinyGrad)
• Can train basic CNNs and Transformers
• Good for learning and research
• Not production-ready

1 YEAR: Research-competitive library
• Most common operations implemented
• GPU acceleration for core operations
• Can replicate most papers

2 YEARS: Production-worthy library
• Distributed training
• Deployment tools
• Performance competitive with PyTorch

3+ YEARS: Ecosystem competitor
• Full feature parity
• Extensive documentation
• Large community
• Industry adoption

🌟 THE GOOD NEWS:
You have the hardest conceptual piece (automatic differentiation)!
Everything else is "just" engineering, optimization, and time.

🚀 RECOMMENDATION:
Focus on the "SHORT TERM" and "MEDIUM TERM" roadmap items.
Build something useful quickly, then optimize and expand.
